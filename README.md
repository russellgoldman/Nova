# Project Description
Meet Nova, an AI chatbot designed to build a bridge between the university students and on campus resources in a humanized way.

We chose the name Nova because in astrology terms, it is defined as “A star showing a sudden large increase in brightness”. We wanted this to be an analogy for how there is always hope, and everyone has the power to change their life for the better.
